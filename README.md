# Untitled Goose Game

This is a new activity to refresh your memory on some topics we covered in previous weeks and to give you some more practice with skills that you might want to use in your final project. I'm going to start it as a follow-along coding exercise to do the desktop layout and then you'll do a mobile layout as independent assignment on your own. 

## Part 1
The first part is a follow-along coding exercise where my video shows you how to create the desktop verion of the site.

## Part 2
â¬‡
For part two you'll do on your own and create a responsive version of the site for mobile devices. 

You've already made responsive sites where the desktop and mobile styles are both in the same stylesheet file. However, this time you'll take a different approach. 

For this assignment you won't be adding any more styles to `main.css`. Instead, you'll use a completely separate style sheet, `mobile.css`, for all of your mobile styles.

Refer to the assignment description in Canvas for the layout grid and PDF file that lists all of the required styles for this part of the assignment.

**Disadvantages** of multiple-file method:
* The browser has to download additional files
* You're starting over from scratch in the mobile stylesheet instead of just modifying what's different
* If you make fundamental visual updates to one stylesheet you'll need to remember to change it in the other file, too

<br>

**Advantages** of the multiple-file method:
* Each style sheet will be simpler because it only contains one possible layout 
* You avoid confusing conflicts between media query style rules and the desktop style rules higher up in the stylesheet
